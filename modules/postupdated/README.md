## Warning:
-This module does not work plug-and-play, it's far from complete!
-Several things have to be added and several changes to Chyrp Lite need to be done for this module to work and to produce valid HTMl5

## Notes:
-needs changes in all feathers in all themes to be able to work, this is done by postinsertions, this and because postinsertions depends on postupdates is why this module and the package postinsertions are merged

## Future functionalities / to-do's:
I want to add at least two functionalities in the future that are related to this:
1.: Add a section "Last updated posts" to the sideline
2.: Add an option "Sort posts on last-updated" (instead of creation-date)
3.: Add an option to show a "New"-icon in front of "Post updated:" within a certain time-period from now, like "show new-icon on all posts updated the last 3 weeks (or whatever value you want)"

## Translations:
The text that has to be added to the feathers contains a translatable string. Inside the .pot-file you have to specify which files contain the text, as for now that can only be two feathers in one theme (topaz) and it should be for all feathers in all themes

## More
Will come (some day)
